                <p>
                    I'm a Systems Engineering student at the Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science of the 
                    Politehnica University of Bucharest and also a full time employee for SAP Bucharest.
                    <br><br>
                    In my current position I'm mainly working on SAP Commerce Cloud implementations that involves 
                    backend development using the Spring Java framework, but I'm also working on some Innovation and IoT projects
                    on the SAP Cloud Platform using technologies like NodeJS and UI5.
                    <br><br>
                    During the rest of the day, I'm usually working on some personal projects and learning new technologies 
                    (like this website that was entirely developed using the Angular framework!). Apart from this, I'm also starting
                     up a new business in the IT area with a couple of friends.
                    <br><br>
                    Besides, I'm a fan of ML and AI, but currently I'm learning the basics. You can find more about me on the social networks (bottom of the page).
